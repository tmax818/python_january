# Four Pillars
--
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
--

--
# Abstraction

- abstraction is focus on essential quailites of an item <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- form over substance <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--
# Polymorphism

```py
class Animal:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def make_noise(self, noise)
        print(f"The {self.name} says {noise}")
```


--
# Inheritance

> the idea that we pass along attributes and methods from one class into a "sub-class" or child class, and not have to re-write the code to make it work. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
--
# Encapsulation
- encapsulation === oop
- reduces dependencies
