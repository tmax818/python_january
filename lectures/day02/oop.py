###### creating an instance of the class ######

# ? create an instance of your Dog class

###### self as a reference to the instance ######

# ? add a method to your Dog class that prints `self` to the console.

# TODO: Chaining Methods

###### returning self ######

# ? modify the `bark` method of your Dog class so you can chain
# ? the bark methods like this: fido.bark().bark().bark() will print

###### Class methods vs Instance Methods ######

# ? create a `Tesla` class:

# ? give the Tesla an instance method that makes sense(i.e you own a Tesla car, what should the car be able to do?).

###### Passing cls instead of self ######
###### cls is a reference to the class ######

# ? give the Tesla class a class method that it would make sense for Tesla the company to have(i.e Tesla the company doesn't need to brake or accelerate, but it may want to keep track of all the Tesla cars it makes!!)

###### class attributes ######

# ? give the Tesla class a class attribute. What is a noun that applies to Tesla the company, but not necessarily an individual Tesla car?
